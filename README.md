Ethical, Legal, Civic, and Social Implications (ELCSI) of Computer Science (CS)
===============================================================================

This repository serves as a consolidated knowledge base for various resources
that relate to the Ethical, Legal, Civic, and Social Implications (ELCSI) of
Computer Science (CS). Such resources may include lists and links to relevant 
conferences, common literature, significant articles, and documents on best
practices and values shared by ELCSI communities. 

**In particular, this repository has a focus on providing resources for 
communities engaged with the ELCSI of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine 
Learning (ML), and Data Science (DS).**

The intent of creating and maintaining this repository is such that individuals
already within ELCSI-related communities, as well as individuals hoping to enter
and engage with these communities, have an open and accessible resource to 
utilize, share, and contribute. The hope is that with a consolidated knowledge 
base, key resources can be made more accessible, and that individuals coming 
from different fields can more easily interface with the existing ELCSI 
discussions. By nature, this repository highlights interdisciplinarity, and
encourages collaboration across computer scientists, policymakers, historians,
philosophers, sociologists, political scientists, economists, ethnographers,
journalists, etc.

If you feel that there are resources that should definitely be included in this
repository, feel free to add them via Pull Request!

Why *ELCSI*?
------------

Having worked within the context of *very* broad interdisciplinary fields such
as "[Science and Society](http://www.nyu.edu/students/academic-services/undergraduate-advisement/unique-academic-opportunities/cross-school-minors/cross-school-minors-alphabetically/minor-in-science-and-society.html)" 
and "[Science and Technology Studies (STS)](http://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/programs/science-and-technology-studies-bs),"
I've often been asked to narrow down and make explicit what sorts of questions 
and subject areas I'm specifically concerned with. Over the years, this has
grown to become quite a non-trivial sort of taxonomical task, with the fear 
that I may settle on a designation that is still too broad, or too narrow, such
that it restricts the perception of what concerns and techniques I am 
interested in exploring.

For a period of time, I addressed my work as involving the "History, 
Philosophy, and Civics of Computer Science," as I am personally and primarily 
influenced by the fields of "[History and Philosophy of Science (HPS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_and_philosophy_of_science)"
and [Civic Tech](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civic_technology). However, such
a name has felt wrong, or simply unfitting, for what it is that I am exactly
concerned with, as the central focus of my work is not the history or the
philosophy itself. Rather, I am more generally concerned with analyzing the
sorts of impacts and implications that new advances and practices in Computer
Science may have on society, using techniques and perspectives from the
humanities and social sciences, such as from history and philosophy.

With this being said, I've wanted to come up with a name that would encapsulate
topics such as "Data Science for Good" or "Ethics of AI," as well as concerns
related to the fairness, accountability, and transparency of techniques that
might be applied to things like predictive policing, credit scoring, quantitative
evaluation, etc. I eventually settled on the acronym "ELCSI," which is a reference 
to, and derived from, the naming of the [ELSI Research Program](https://www.genome.gov/elsi/), which was established in
1990 as a crucial component of the Human Genome Project to explore questions
of ethical, legal, and social implications of genomic research. Here, I have added
the 'C' to emphasize the importance and relevance of the work that civic tech has 
done thus far, and to highlight in some regard the relationship that CS has to
governance. In an attempt to keep the acronym from growing too long, I did have
to omit one particular area that I find to be important &mdash; public
policy &mdash; although my hope is that influencing public policies and regulations
should always be in the back of our minds when discussing ELCSI at all.

Updates and "Version" History
-----------------------------

- *Nov 20*: Created this repository! Added a list of NYC conferences for ELCSI 
of AI/ML/DS. Planning on adding a list of relevant and important articles next.
