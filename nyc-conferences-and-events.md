List of NYC Conferences and Events for ELCSI of AI/ML/DS
========================================================

This is a growing list of conferences&#42; in NYC related to the Ethical, Legal,
Civic, and Social Implications (ELCSI) of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine
Learning (ML), and Data Science (DS).

Although there are many conferences on topics such as Data Science and Machine
Learning that may involve individual panels on ELCSI, this list is dedicated to
conferences that are explicitly *interdisiplinary* in nature and encourage
discussion across computer scientists, policymakers, historians, sociologists,
philosophers, political scientists, economists, ethnographers, etc.

The original intent of this list is to create an open and public resource to
keep track of a growing number of conferences within this specific community,
since I am not aware of any other consolidated list with its scope limited to
ELCSI-centric conferences in particular. As for the NYC specification, this is
merely an artifact of the fact that I myself am located in the NYC area, and
that there has been a unique and very rapidly growing climate of interest in the
ELCSI of AI, ML, and DS in NYC. Such a list can predictably (and should) be made
for other locations across the world.

The hope with this list is to have a common, singular resource for folks who 
work within this community, or wish to enter into this community, to utilize.

I encourage folks to add to this list via Pull Request. :)
